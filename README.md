# Flexible-PDF-estimation

This repository presents the software used to estimate the cumulative density funtion (CDF) and the probability density function (PDF) of random variables by using a LUT interpolated by cubic splines [1]. The bidimensional version, for estimating joint CDF and joint PDF by using bidimensional splines [2], is also presented.
